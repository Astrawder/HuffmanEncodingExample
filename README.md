# Huffman Encoding Example
CSCI 202 Data Structures

This project shows how text is encoded using Huffman encoding. This project doesn't actually compress files but is an example of how the encoding works.
When inputting a text file make sure the text file doesn't contain ampersand, caret or pipe symbols.
