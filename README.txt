	This is a test file showing that you can use spaces, newlines and horizontal tabs and that you should not use
specific symbols such as the underscore, caret or pipe symbol when wanting to encode a text file with this program.
These symbols are used to represent spaces, newlines and tabs.
Other whitespace characters are not supported, so dont use
any other whitespace characters other than space, newline and tab
when writing to a text file that you would like to encode with this program!
The ampersand should also not be used becasue it represents internal nodes of 
the Huffman tree, therfore any node with the ampersand character will be ignored by the encode 
and decode process of the program!

	Another thing to add is that just using Huffman coding and writing it back to this text file is
not effecient enough to compress files properly. It is really just encoding the 
file and not compressing it, so the file sizes will not be smaller
and might be bigger. Other things would need to be done to get
successful compression and the encoding would not be written to a text file. 
It would be written to a binary file. I will most likely keep working on
this project and make changes to successfully compress a file and create my own custom compression!
